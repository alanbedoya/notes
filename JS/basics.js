Ex:
Math.random(); //returns a number between 0 and 1



Libraries

Numbers
Numbers are a primitive data type. They include the set of all integers and floating point numbers.
Ex:

let price = 4.99;


String .length 
The .length property of a string returns the number of characters that make up the string.

Ex:
let lateToWork = true;


Math.random()
