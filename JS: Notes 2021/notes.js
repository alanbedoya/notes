//Operator precdence

 Operator precedence determines the way in which operators are paresed with respect to each other. Operators with higher precedence become the operands of operators with lower precedence. 


 //What is the DOM?
 //DOM
 Document Object Model: Structured representation of HTML documents allows JS to access HTML elements and styles to manipulate them.


 //classList
 When wrting a classList remove or add make sure to not put a '.' in front of the class becuase you're not selecting the class you're calling it.


 //Operator
 +=	Addition assignment	Adds the value on the right to the variable value on the left, then returns the new variable value	x += 4;	x = x + 4;
-=	Subtraction assignment	Subtracts the value on the right from the variable value on the left, and returns the new variable value	x -= 3;	x = x - 3;
*=	Multiplication assignment	Multiplies the variable value on the left by the value on the right, and returns the new variable value	x *= 3;	x = x * 3;
/=	Division assignment	Divides the variable value on the left by the value on the right, and returns the new variable value	x /= 5;	x = x / 5;


 //toogle()
 It adss a class if it's not there or it will remove it. Ex: player0Element.classList.toggle('player--acitve);


 //High-level overview of JS
  * JS
    * JS is a high-level, object-oriented, multi-paradigm programming language.
  * High-level
    * Everything happens automatically
  * Garbage-collected 
    * Cleaning the memory so we don't have to
  * Interpreted or just-in-time compiled
    * Converts code to machine code (1's & 0's) to be complied. Happens inside the JS engine.
  * Multi-paradigm
    * Paradigm:
      * An approach and mindset of structuring code, which will direct your coding style and technique. 
      *  1)Procedural programming
      *  2)Object-oriented progrmaing (OOP)
      *  3)Functional programming (FP)
      * Imerative or Declarative 
  * Prototype-based object-oriented 
    *  More on it in the OOP section.
  * First-class functions 
    * In a language with first-class functions, functions are simply treated as variables. We can pass them into other functions, and return them from functions. 
  * Single-threaded & Non-blocking event loop 
    * Concurrency model: how the JS engine handles multiple tasks happening at the same time.
    * JS runs in one single thread, so it can only do one thing at a time.
    * Sounds like it would block the single thread. However, we want non-blocking behavior.
    * By using an event loop it takes long running tasks, executes thme in the background, and puts them back in the main thread once they are finished.  


 //The JS Engine and Runtime
 * Compilation vs. Interpretation 
  * Compilation:
    * Entire code is converted into machine code at once, and written to a binary file that can be executed by a computer. 
      * See Video 90 for EX. 
  * Interpreetaion:
    * Interpreter runs through the source code and executes it line by line. 
      * See Video 90 for EX. 
  * Just-in-time (JIT) compilation
    * Entire code is converted into machine code at once, then executed immediately. 
      * See Video 90 for EX.    
  *JS engine
    * 1) Parsing 
    * 2) Compilaton
    * 3) Execution 
      * Happens in the Call Stack
    * 4) Optimization

  
//Execution contexts and The Call Stack 
* What is an execution context? 
  * Execution Context: 
   * Environment in which a piece of JS is executed. Stores all the necessary information for some code to be executed.
  * Execution steps: 
    * Compilation
    * Creation of global execution context (for top-level code)
    * Execution of top-level code 
    * Execution of functions and waiting for callbacks
* Exactly one global execution context (EC):
  * Default context, created for code that is not inside any function (top-level). 
* One execution context per function: 
  * For each function call, a new execution context is created. 
* What's inside execution context?
  * Variable Environment 
    * let, const, and var declarations
    * functions
    * arguments object 
  * Scope chain
  * this keyword
    * Generated during "creation phase", right before execution    
* The Call Stack
  * "Place" where execution contexts get stacked on top of each other, to keep track of where we are in the execution. 
  * Like a map. 
  

//Scope and The Scope Chain
* Scope Concepts 
  * Scoping:
    * How our program's variables are organized and accessed. "Where do variables live?" or "Where can we access a certain variable, and where not?" 
  * Lexical Scoping:
    * Scoping is controlled by placement of functions and blocks in the code. 
  * Scope: 
    * Space or environment in which a certain variable is declared(variable environment in case of functions). There is a global scope, function scope, and block scope.
  * Scope of a variable: 
    * Region of our code where a certain variable can be accessed. 
* The 3 types of scope
  * Global Scope
    * Outside of any function or block
    * Variables declared in global scope are accessible everywhere
  * Function Scope
    * Variables are accessible only inside function, NOT outside
    * Also called local scope 
  * Block Scope (ES6)
    * Variables are accessible only inside blcok(block scoped)
    * However, this only applies to let and const variables!
    * Functions are also block scoped (only in strict mode)
* The Scope chain
  * Scopes have access to variables from all outer scopes. 
  * Variables in scope chain only look up the chain not down. 
  * let and const are block-scoped 
  * var is a function-scoped
* summary
  * Scoping asks the question "Where do variables live?" or "Where can we access a certain variable, and where not?"
  * There are 3 types of scope in JS: the global scope, scopes defined by functions, and scopes defined by blocks. 
  * only let and const variables are block-scoped. Variables declared with var end up in the closest function scope. 
  * In JS, we have lexical scoping, so the rules of where we can access variables are based on exactly where in the code functions and blocks are written.
  * Every scope always has access to all the variables from all its outer scops. This is the scope chain!
  * When a vairable is not in the current scope, the engine looks up in the scope chain unitl it finds the variable it's looking for. This is called variable lookup.
  * The scope chian is a one-way street: a scope will never, ever have access to the variables of an inner scope. 
  * The scope chain is a certain scope is equal to adding together all the variable environments of the all parent scopes.
  * The scope chain has nothing to do with the order in which functions were called. It does not affet the scope chain at all!


//Scoping in Practice 
function calcAge(birthYear) {
  const age = 2037 - birthYear;

  function printAge() {
    const output = `You are ${age}, born in ${birthYear}`;
    console.log(output);

    if (birthYear >= 1981 && birthYear <= 1996) {
      const str = `Oh, and you're a millenial, ${firstName}`;
      console.log(str);

      function add(a, b) {
        return a + b;
      }
    }
  }
  printAge();
  return age;
}

const firstName = 'Alan';
calcAge(1993);


//Variable Environment: Hoisting and The TDZ
* Hoisting in JS 
  * Hoisting
    * Makes some type of variables accessible/usable in the code before they are actually declared. "Variables lifted to the top of their scope."
    * Before execution, code is scanned for variable declarations, and for each variable, a new property is created in the variable environment object. 
    * Function declarations
      * Hoisted: Yes
      * Initial Value: Actual function
      * Scope: Block (In strict mode. Otherwise the scope is function.)
    * Var variables 
      * Hoisted: Yes
      * Initial Value: Undefined
      * Scope: Function
    * Let and Const variables 
      * Hoisted: No
      * Initial Value: <uniitialized>, TDZ(Temporal Dead Zone)
      * Scope: Block
    * Function expressions and arrows 
      * Depends if using var or let/const  
      * Hoisted: ?
      * Initial Value: ?
      * Scope: ?  
  * Why TDZ?
    * Makes it easier to avoid and catch errors: accessing variables before declaration is bad practice and should be avoided. 
    * Makes const variables actually work. 
  * Why Hoisting?
    * Using functions before actual declaration. 
    * var Hoisting is just a byproduct   
  * Hoisting example:
    * Variables
      * console.log(me);
        console.log(job);
        console.log(year);

        var me = 'Alan';
        let job = 'developer';
        const year = '1993'; 
    * Functions
    * console.log(me);
      console.log(job);
      console.log(year);
      
      var me = 'Alan';
      let job = 'developer';
      const year = '1993';
      
      console.log(addDecl(2, 3));
      console.log(addExpr(2, 3));
      console.log(addArrow(2, 3));
      
      function addDecl(a, b) {
        return a + b;
      }
      
      const addExpr = function (a, b) {
        return a + b;
      };
      
      const addArrow = (a, b) => a + b;   


//The this Keyword
* How the this keyword works
  * this keyword/variable: 
    * Special variable that is created for every execution context (every function). It takes the value of (points to) the "owner" of the function in which the this keyword is used. 
  * this is NOT static. It depends on how the function is called, and its value is only assigned when the function is actually called. 
  * Method
    * this = <Object that is calling the method>
    * const
    * const alan = {
        name: 'Alan',
        year: 1993,
        calcAge: () => {
          return 2037 - this.year;
        },
      };
      alan.calcAge();
  * Simple function call
    * this = undefined
      * only in stric mode! Otherwise: window (in the browser)
  * Arrow functions
    * this = <this of surrounding function (lexical this)>
  * Event listener 
    * this = <DOM element that the handler is attached to>
  * new, call apply, bind
    * Will learn more latter. 
  * this does NOT point to the function itself, and also NOT the its variable environment! 


// Regular functions vs arrow functions
* Example:
  *
